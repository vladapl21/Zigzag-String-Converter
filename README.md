# Zigzag-String-Converter
The string "PAYPALISHIRING" is written in a zigzag pattern on a given number of rows like this: (you may want to display this pattern in a fixed font for better legibility)  P   A   H   N A P L S I I G Y   I   R And then read line by line: "PAHNAPLSIIGYIR"  The code will take a string and make this conversion given a number of rows.
